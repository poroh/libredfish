These folders were created by this tool: https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Mockup-Creator

I ran it like this:
```
docker run --rm --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v /home/graham/src/libredfish/tests/mockups/lenovo:/mockup dmtf/redfish-mockup-creator:latest -u Egxadmin -p <pw-go-here> -r <BMC-IP-ADDRESS-GO-BRR> -S
```

The mockup server which the integration test runs is https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Mockup-Server
